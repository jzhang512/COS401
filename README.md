# COS401
###Supreme Court Oral Argument Summarization & Simplification

Packaged in a Jupyter notebook, we wrote a multi-step summarization and simplification program for use with SCOTUS oral argument transcripts. We explored extractive (BERT) and abstractive (Legal-Pegasus) methods for summarization and focused on lexical and syntactical simplification tactics to enhance readability. In turn, our summaries achieved superior scores to GPT-3 and other LLM in various readability metrics.
